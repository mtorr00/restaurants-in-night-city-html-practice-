                <h4>Bleu</h4>
                <p>

                <h4>Pepper & Spice</h4>
                <p>A unique locale on the culnary map of Night City. This eatery was founded by renowned travel icon Tony Haleek. It stands apart from the competition thanks to its diversive menu of transcontinental fusion dishes, most of which are offered at surprisingly reasonable prices. Caribbean, Polish, Kenyan - it's all here. Just not in the combination you've ever seen before... The crowd favorite? Haleek's own vanilla dumplings.</p>

                <h4>Buck-A-Slice</h4>
                <p>
                    According to urban legend, the NCPD has en entire ile on the mysterious deaths of homeless people whose last meal was pizza from Buck-A-Slice. True or not, bargain-seekers living on a eurodollar-a-lunch budget should still be prepared for gastrointestinal distress. Worth the risk? Only if you want a greasy slice of authentic Night City flavor. Plus, their secret recipe chilispurt scopperoni is unlike anything you've ever tasted, but only available on special request.

                <h4>Ru Lai</h4>
                <p>At Ru Lai you'll find all of the three P's - potent, punchy, and pungent. Every visit to this local favorite is like playing a game of Chinese roulette. Regulars at Ru Lai claim you're just as likely to get "bearable" egg rolls and "halfway decent" rangoons as you are tainted tofu or Sichuan salmonella. You have been warned.</p>
